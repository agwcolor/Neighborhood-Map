## Instructions

Using the Neighborhood Map app

1. (search) - In search bar, enter query. The list of 10 items will filter on your search. The Markers on the map will be updated. (You can change the number of items to search for, place, query in the utils.js folder)

2. Click on the filter list in the side bar to make the corresponding map marker bounce.
3. Click on a map marker to open an info window with info retrieved from the Foursquare API. 

## Background
This project demonstrates an example of a React Controlled component where the UI dynamically updates as the user interacts with it (e.g. the dynamic side bar and map). The state of the React data is always up to date, the "single source of truth", and creates a dynamic user experience. (https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)

This project also implements using the Google Maps API and the Foursquare API to retrieve venue data and map data. (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ | https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api). 


## Dependencies
Using NPM install, install the following project dependencies in the /neighborhood-map folder from the command line if you don't have them already.  Check the package.json file if you have any issues. :

"react": "^16.5.2",
"react-dom": "^16.5.2",


You will need internet access. The google maps API and the Foursquare API require live fetching of data.  There is a service worker running for caching.

## Contributing
Map data retrieved by Google Maps API.
Places data retrieved by Foursquare API.

Ideas regarding how to approach this project were were found in Udacity course resources, especially using the walkthrough by Ryan Waite (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J6fs_BlVC0&feature=youtu.be), the Udacity Knowledge Boards, as well as Udacity course materials on React, React JS (https://reactjs.org/), Google Maps API docs, CSS Tricks, and Stack Overflow.
